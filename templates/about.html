    <h2>What is GenerosiMe?</h2>
    <p>
      In the United States, 31 percentâ€”or 133 billion pounds of food supply at the retail and consumer levels in 2010 went uneaten. GenerosiMe aims to address this problem by providing an easy, and quick platform for resturants and businesses to donate uneaten food products and unused items to homeless shelters.
